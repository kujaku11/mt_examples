    "This tutorial will examine how to build an mth5 file and write MT time series data for each station in a survey in parallel by utilising [h5py's Parallel HDF5](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/mpi.html) functionality. Parallel HDF5 allows users to open files across multiple parallel processes by utilising the Messaging Passing Interface (MPI) standard in [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in order to use Parallel HDF5, both HDF5 and h5py must be compiled with MPI support turned on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will be converting Earth Data Logger (ASCII) time series data from 93 stations of the AusLAMP Musgraves Province survey (see https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/5eaa30d63bd17). The ASCII time series were concatenated per run for each station and the total volume of time series data was 106 GB. 90 of the 93 stations were a single run - stations SA246, SA299 and SA324-2 had multiple runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example was tested on the [National Computational Infrastructure's Gadi HPC system](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems). Gadi is Australiaâ€™s most powerful supercomputer, a highly parallel cluster comprising more than 200,000 processor cores on ten different types of compute nodes. The example also makes use of the [NCI-geophysics 2022.06 module](https://opus.nci.org.au/x/1wG7CQ) which contains Parallel HDF5.\n"

    "Generating one mth5 file for many stations can take a significant amount of time if no parallelism is introduced. For the Musgraves example above, if using the mth5 library alone it would have taken approximately 14 hours to generate our final mth5 file. By utilising Parallel HDF5 we have managed to reduce this time to approximately 35 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the _\"all stations in a single mth5 file\"_ model, the bottleneck lies in generating the mth5 skeleton as this can't be done in parallel. The authors have created the tutorial [mth5_in_parallel_one_file_per_station](https://github.com/kujaku11/mth5/blob/master/examples/notebooks/mth5_in_parallel_one_file_per_station.ipynb) that shows how to generate a single mth5 file per station in parallel, which yields much quicker results than the _\"all stations in a single mth5 file\"_ model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example only dealt with the writing of MT time series data and did not consider [mt_metadata](https://mt-metadata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The [mth5_in_parallel_one_file_per_station](https://github.com/kujaku11/mth5/blob/master/examples/notebooks/mth5_in_parallel_one_file_per_station.ipynb) tutorial demonstrates how one could add mt_metadata into their mth5 automations."
