    "# Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are demonstrating `mtpy-v2` the newest version of `MTpy`.  There have been major changes and is backward incompatible with v1.0.  The key changes are that usage is more centralized and data containers are no longer EDI specific.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Key new objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. [MT](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/01_mt_object.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MT` object is not new, but some of the functionality, methods, and attributes are different.  The `MT` object holds a single transfer function and provides methods for manipulating, analyzing, and plotting. It is the basic object used in `mtpy-v2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. [MTCollection and MTData](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/02_mt_collection_musgraves.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "`MTCollection` and `MTData` are new objects that are the central objections in `mtpy-v2`.  `MTCollection` is a MTH5 file that contains transfer functions.  `MTData` is an object in RAM that you can manipulate, analyze, and plot without changing the original transfer functions.  `MTData` is the main object that `mtpy-v2` uses.  In this example data from the Musgraves survey is used to create an `MTCollection`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "In these notebooks examples are provided to plot the Musgraves data in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. [Plot Stations](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/03_plot_stations.ipynb)\n",
    "In this example we will look at plotting a station map and setting different background images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. [Plot MT Response](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/04_plot_mt_response.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will look at plotting the MT response in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. [Plot Depth of Investigation](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/05_plot_depth_of_investigation.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Its nice to have an idea of how deep your data is senstive to, here we plot depth of investigation using a Bostick-Niblett transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### d. [Plot Resistivity and Phase Maps](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/06_plot_resistivity_phase_maps.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first pass to look at your data plotting apparent resistivity and phase for different periods is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### e. [Plot Resistivity and Phase Pseudosections](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/07_resistivity_phase_pseudosection.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a profile line of data or cut a profile line from grid data, a useful plot is looking at apparent resistivity and phase for all periods as a pseudosection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### f. [Plot Strike](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/08_plot_strike.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Geoelectric strike estimation is an imporant quantity for analysis.  In this example different ways to plot geoelectric strike are shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### g. [Plot Phase Tensor Maps](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/09_phase_tensor_maps.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase tensor are a nice way to represent your data. Here phase tensor maps are presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### h. [Plot Phase Tensor Pseudosections](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/10_phase_tensor_pseudosection.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding changes in the phase tensor over period is a nice way to understand the subsurface.  Here plotting a profile as a phase tensor pseudosection is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to understand you data is to create resistivity models through inversion.  There are many open source codes available and we are working to support creating input files for each. \n",
    "\n",
    "## [ModEM](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/11_making_modem_inputs.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "ModEM has been a popular 3D inversion code over the last decade or so because its academically free and is parallel for use on HPC.  Here we present ways to create input files for ModEM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [ModEM Outputs](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/14_modem_outputs.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "When ModEM inversions have finished you want to look at your data, here we present some different ways of looking at your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [SimPEG](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/mt_examples/notebooks/mtpy/12_simpeg_1d_inversion.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "SimPEG is an open-source Python package developed by a group at the University of British Columbia.  It is not just for MT, but includes modeling for potential fields and other DC and EM methods.  Here we present a 1D inversion that is a method of the `MT` object.  There is ongoing development to incorporate 2D and 3D into `mtpy-v2` and optimize on HPC.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Master Controller**: We'd like `mtpy-v2` be the main package used in the full workflow.  This includes developing recipes for processing time series data to create inptu files for modeling.\n",
    " - **Optimzation**: The other main development is optimization and speeding processes up for use on a local machine or HPC.  This would include making a multi-indexed Dask array.  "
